# Hangman Project
<p><strong>My first project in C++.</strong></p>
<p>A simple project in C++ that attempts to recreate the classic hangman game.</p>

## How to play
<p>The files can be run on the simple terminal in Linux or VS Code. <br>
    Requirements: G++ compiler installed and working</p>
<p>STEPS:
<ol>
  <li> Download the 3 files and put all 3 in the same folder.</li>
  <li> Open the terminal in that folder.</li>
  <li> Run the following code:
        
      `g++ hangman.cpp hangmanfunc.cpp`
  <strong>Note</strong>:Ensure that g++ compiler is installed
  </li>
  <li> Run this code:
    <ul>
      <li>  
        
          ```a.exe```
          
  In VS Code terminal
      </li>
      <li>
        ```./a.out```
        In linux terminal
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>That is it! You can now play the classic hangman on your favourite terminal</p>

## Logic
<p>I have used linkings across 2 files and also created a header file to facilitate this.</p>
