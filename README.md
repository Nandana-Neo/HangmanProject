# Hangman Project
<p><strong>My first project in C++.</strong></p>
<p>A simple project in C++ that attempts to recreate the classic hangman game.</p>

## Game
<p>The game starts off on a simple home page:
![]()<br>
Once 'p' is pressed, the game starts. 
A random word(somewhat) is chosen by the compiler and the player is tasked at guessing it in 7 chances.
![]()<br>
The hangman is drawn at each step. 0 wrong choices would show a happy man.
![]()<br>
The player wins if he/she is able to guess the word in 7 chances. 
![]()<br>
    OR else..
![]()
</p>

## How to play
<p>The files can be run on the simple terminal in Linux or VS Code. <br>
    Requirements: G++ compiler installed and working</p>
<p>STEPS:
<ol>
  <li> Download the 3 files and put all 3 in the same folder.</li>
  <li> Open the terminal in that folder.</li>
  <li> Run the following code: 
      
      ```
      g++ hangman.cpp hangmanfunc.cpp
      ```            
  <strong>Note</strong>:Ensure that g++ compiler is installed
  </li>
  <li> Run this code:
    <ul>
      <li> In VS Code terminal `a.exe`
      </li>
      <li> 
        In linux terminal `./a.out`
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>That is it! You can now play the classic hangman on your favourite terminal. Have fun!</p>

## Logic
<p>I have used linkings across 2 files and also created a header file to facilitate this.</p>
